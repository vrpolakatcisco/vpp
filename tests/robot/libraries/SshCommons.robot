    [Arguments]    ${command}    ${expected_rc}=0    ${ignore_stderr}=${False}    ${ignore_rc}=${False}
    [Documentation]    Execute \${command} on current SSH session, log results, maybe fail on nonempty stderr, check \${expected_rc}, return stdout.

Write_Bare_Ctrl_C
    [Documentation]    Construct ctrl+c character and SSH-write it (without endline) to the current SSH connection.
    ...    Do not read anything yet.
