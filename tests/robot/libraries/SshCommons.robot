Open_Ssh_Connection
    [Arguments]    ${name}    ${ip}    ${user}=${KUBE_DEFAULT_USER}    ${psswd}=${KUBE_DEFAULT_PASSWD}
    [Documentation]    Create SSH connection to \{ip} aliased as \${name} and log in using \${user} and \${pswd} (or rsa).
    ...    Log to output file. The new connection is left active.

Execute_Command_With_Copied_File
    [Arguments]    ${command_prefix}    ${file_path}    ${expected_rc}=0    ${ignore_stderr}=${False}
    [Documentation]    Put file to current remote directory and execute command which takes computed file name as argument.

Execute_Command_And_Log
    [Arguments]    ${command}    ${expected_rc}=0    ${ignore_stderr}=${False}    ${ignore_rc}=${False}
    [Documentation]    Execute \${command} on current SSH session, log results, maybe fail on nonempty stderr, check \${expected_rc}, return stdout.
    BuiltIn.Log_Many    ${command}    ${expected_rc}    ${ignore_stderr}
    BuiltIn.Comment    TODO: Add logging to file. See https://github.com/contiv/vpp/issues/200

Write_Bare_Ctrl_C
    [Documentation]    Construct ctrl+c character and SSH-write it (without endline) to the current SSH connection.
    ...    Do not read anything yet.
    ${ctrl_c} =    BuiltIn.Evaluate    chr(int(3))
    SSHLibrary.Write_Bare    ${ctrl_c}

Restore_Current_Ssh_Connection_From_Index
    [Arguments]    ${connection_index}
    [Documentation]    Restore active SSH connection in SSHLibrary to given index.
    ...
    ...    Restore the currently active connection state in
    ...    SSHLibrary to match the state returned by "Switch
    ...    Connection" or "Get Connection". More specifically makes
    ...    sure that there will be no active connection when the
    ...    \${connection_index} reported by these means is None.
    ...
    ...    There is a misfeature in SSHLibrary: Invoking "SSHLibrary.Switch_Connection"
    ...    and passing None as the "index_or_alias" argument to it has exactly the
    ...    same effect as invoking "Close Connection".
    ...    https://github.com/robotframework/SSHLibrary/blob/master/src/SSHLibrary/library.py#L560
    ...
    ...    We want to have Keyword which will "switch out" to previous
    ...    "no connection active" state without killing the background one.
    ...
    ...    As some suites may hypothetically rely on non-writability of active connection,
    ...    workaround is applied by opening and closing temporary connection.
    ...    Unfortunately this will fail if run on Jython and there is no SSH server
    ...    running on localhost, port 22 but there is nothing easy that can be done about it.
    BuiltIn.Run Keyword And Return If    ${connection_index} is not None    SSHLibrary.Switch Connection    ${connection_index}
    # The background connection is still current, bury it.
    SSHLibrary.Open Connection    127.0.0.1
    SSHLibrary.Close Connection

Run_Keyword_Preserve_Connection
    [Arguments]    ${keyword_name}    @{args}    &{kwargs}
    [Documentation]    Store current connection index, run keyword returning its result, restore connection in teardown.
    ...    Note that in order to avoid "got positional argument after named arguments",
    ...    it is safer to use positional (not named) arguments on call.
    ${current_connection} =    SSHLibrary.Get_Connection
    BuiltIn.Run_Keyword_And_Return    ${keyword_name}    @{args}    &{kwargs}
